1. Gerschgorin's Disk Theorem

Let A be an nxn (real or complex) matrix. Then every eigenvalue of A is contained within a Gerschgorin disk.

The ith Gerschgorin disk is the circular disk D_i in the complex plane with center a_ii and radiu r_i. That is,

D_i = { z in C : | z - a_ii| <= r_i }

r_i = SUM[j != i](|a_ij|)

2. Markov Chain

If P is the nxn transition (stochastic) matrix of a Markov chain, then 1 is an eigenvalue of P
